# Learning-Journal-week01

#Learning Activities & Resources

This week I set up a website template based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and studied some of the LinkedIn Learning courses and some other online tutorials. I get much help from Bootstrap and W3Schools.

#Estimated Hours

I spent about 5 hours doing this week's practical, learning and doing it.

#Content Insights

Bootstrap and W3Schools offer almost everything needed to design a website. I learned how to add elements like a navbar, footer, body, carousel, and other essential components for building a site. W3Schools' live demo allows me to experiment with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, helping me design my website's features and appearance exactly as I want.

#Career/Employ-ability/Learning Insights

Web developers and designers widely use Bootstrap to make or customize websites without altering the entire template.  I understand that using Bootstrap makes styling more efficient and allows changes without worrying about them being overwritten. However, since it focuses on front-end development, I’m not sure if I’ll rely on it much in the future, as it’s not the main area I’m aiming to pursue for my career. It was interesting to explore how front-end developers use tools like Bootstrap and W3Schools, but whether I continue using them depends on where my career path leads.
