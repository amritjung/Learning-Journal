# Learning-Journal-week01

#Learning Activities & Resources

This week I set up a website template based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and studied some of the LinkedIn Learning courses and some other online tutorials. I get much help from Bootstrap and W3Schools.

#Estimated Hours

I spent about 5 hours doing this week's practical, learning and doing it.

Content Insights

I re-learned that HTML is responsible for structuring the content of a website, such as organizing text, images, and links, while CSS is used to control the visual design and layout, including colours, fonts, and spacing. This separation of form (CSS) and function (HTML) is important because it makes websites easier to maintain and update. It also ensures the design can be adapted for different devices, like desktops, tablets, and smartphones, without affecting the core content structure.

Career/Employ-ability/Learning Insights

I realized that watching too many tutorial videos at once made me lose focus. Instead, breaking them into shorter sessions followed by hands-on practice kept me more engaged and helped me retain what I learned without needing to repeat the videos. This way, I could immediately apply the new skills, reinforcing my understanding.
Web developers and designers widely use Bootstrap to make or customize websites without altering the entire template.  I understand that using Bootstrap makes styling more efficient and allows changes without worrying about them being overwritten. However, since it focuses on front-end development, I’m not sure if I’ll rely on it much in the future, as it’s not the main area I’m aiming to pursue for my career. It was interesting to explore how front-end developers use tools like Bootstrap and W3Schools, but whether I continue using them depends on where my career path leads.
